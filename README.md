# smart-recipe-api
This api will take input of the ingredients in your kitchen/fridge and return a list of recipies that can be made with them. This project is designed to show my knowledge and experience in cloud development, CI/CD, micro-services, and security best practices through a fun idea that I use AI for already on a regular basis.
